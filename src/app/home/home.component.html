            <p class="lead">We are conducting a study to find out whether human-like chatbot abilities improve learning. As a participant in this study, you will be interacting with a chatbot - which will help you learn about a certain topic - and answering a series of questions based on your conversations with them. 
              Your responses will help us understand the impact of chatbot personality on learning outcomes.</p>

            <h3 class="display-4">Heads Up!!!</h3>
            <ul class="list-unstyled">
             <p>Take part in our study to determine if chatbots improve learning outcomes. You'll start by taking a quiz on Javascript before chatting with ScriptBuddy, our chatbot. Don't worry if you don't know the answers â€“ just do your best! After chatting with  ScriptBuddy, you'll take the same quiz again to see if your score improves. Please note that this is an experiment, not a test of your programming abilities. Sign up/login to begin the quiz!</p>
